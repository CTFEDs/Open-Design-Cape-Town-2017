# Open Design Cape Town CTFEDs Workshop

From their site (emphasis added)

## What is Open Design Cape Town

Open Design Festival is a 12-day city-wide festival. It is one of the most dynamic and diverse **design-focused** festivals on the Cape Town calendar. The festival is an interactive platform that attracts participants from across diverse demographics and communities. Most of the Open Design events are free to enter, ensuring that people from all walks of life can participate, **taking design innovation to the people**.

## Why is the Open Design Festival important?

The Open Design programme engages design practitioners, entrepreneurs, managers, media, educators, students and members of the public to share design, innovation, ideas and inspiration with each other. Our mission is to develop a culture of design as a foundation for future generations of entrepreneurs, change-makers and innovators who use **design and innovation** to gain and maintain their **competitive edge and drive socio-economic change** in their communities and cities.

This is a vital part of **developing a culture of design and innovation** that will increase social cohesion, economic development and nation building, creating **inclusive, accessible and sustainable** communities and cities.

## From the footer

Design is the unifying thread that links innovation, education and community as the building blocks of a sustainable, inclusive, prosperous society. The Open Design Festival brings these concepts together in a 12-day programme of inspiration, discussion and discovery.

## Format ideas for the workshop

Something that requires a ‚Äúlow‚Äù amount of prep, given that we‚Äôll be running the speaking workshop in August too üò±.

[Lean Coffee](http://leancoffee.org/) could be a good match. About 5 or 6 people per table works well.

We could:

-  let people divide into groups and choose topics.
- have tables with vague topics on already, and let people choose by topic. If a table has too many people, we can have two tables on the same topic.
- Topics:
    - could be one word (ish) things like: universal design; universal access; innovation; education; community.
    - could be discussion-provoking sentences like ‚Äúgood design creates social cohesion‚Äù
    - should be FED-focused. Steer a bit from ‚Äúdesign‚Äù to ‚ÄúFED and UX‚Äù

Lean Coffee works best when it‚Äôs low-touch from the organisers, so: **set the stage and the broad topic to give them some focus**, and let them at it. Have a few ideas ready, in case people need or want prompts.
