# Notes, for next time

- we scored great on the "I got what I wanted out of the workshop" and well on the "I'm likely to achieve one of my open design goals soon" [targets](https://github.com/CTFEDs/Open-Design-Cape-Town-2017/blob/master/print/workshop-targets.pdf)
- we ran **long** on the intro: it took about 45 minutes, I think. The Lean Coffee cycles were fine, though, since they had the 5 minute timers. If we want more blocks, we need to tighten the intro a bit.
