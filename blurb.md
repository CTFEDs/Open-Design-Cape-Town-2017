## About the workshop

"Open Design Cape Town workshop: changing the world with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript"

[Open Design Cape Town](http://opendesignct.com/) says that **design is the unifying thread that links innovation, education and community as the building blocks of a sustainable, inclusive, prosperous society**. Front-end development is how we bring to life those designs. Hey, go us! ðŸ™Œ

Join us for a workshop-style discussion (in a [Lean Coffee](http://leancoffee.org/) format (more on that below)) where weâ€™ll discover interesting things, get inspired, and see how Front-end developers can change the world. We might even call on Front-end devâ€™s BFF, User Experience, to help us out.
